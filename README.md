# Train-Scheduler
For this particular assignment, my task is to create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. I will be utilizing the following programs: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Firebase to create this application. 
This application will retrieve and manipulate information using Moment.js. The website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
The user is allowed to input their Train Name, Destination, First Train Time, and frequency.
